# Reinforcement Learning Training

This is a repository created for the sole purpose of practicing reinforcement learning through the "Deep reinforcement learning course" created by Thomas Simonini that you can find at the following address: https://simoninithomas.github.io/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/.

The notebooks used are organized in folders, one for each different type of algorithm.
